In this work, we proposed a mechanism dubbed "laser-assisted dipole-dipole interactions", which enables us to engineer gauge fields in Rydberg atom arrays. The essence of this method is to modulate the dipolar interaction between Rydberg atoms using lasers. This method has made possible the realization of a number of lattice models on Rydberg platforms, for example, [FQHE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13104), [Kitaev Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12905), model with [exact mobility edge](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.176401).
