title: "Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Lind-2025
excerpt: 'We analyzed the structure of the spectrum of Lindbladians where the underlying Hamiltonian has integrals of motions (IOMs), and the dissipation is weak and local. We showed that certain slow modes stand out in the spectrum by having slow decay rates, which have a correspondence to the IOMs of the Hamiltonian.'

In this work, we studied the spectrum of Lindbladian superoperators. We consider the Hamiltonian part having integrals of motions (IOMs), while the dissipation part consist of weak and local jump operators. Building on previous results that showed the dissipative decay of an operator in such setting is roughly proportional to the size of the operator, we showed that IOMs would have slower decay than generic operators due to their immunity to operator growth. With this, we showed that diagonalizing the Lindbladian can reveal the IOMs of the system, with both numerical evidence and a perturbation theory argument.
