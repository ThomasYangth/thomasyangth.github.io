In this work, we derived the saddle-point asymptotic formulae for two-point Green''s functions on non-Hermitian lattices. The result is applicable in arbitrary dimensions. This can characterize the dynamics of non-Hermitian skin modes, wave packets in dissipative media, and spectral densities of quasi-particles with finite lifetime.
