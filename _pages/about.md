My name is Tian-Hua Yang. I'm currently a 4-th year undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University. My research focus in on condensed matter theory. Research areas that I have touched upon includes quantum simulations in optical Raman lattices and Rydberg atom systems, non-Hermitian topology, and quantum information. I'm currently interested in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and quantum information theory.

I have applied for Ph.D. programs starting Fall 2023. Good luck for my applications [fingers crossed].

I am also a BP (British Parliamentary) debater, vice-president of the Speechcrafter English Debating Society at PKU.
