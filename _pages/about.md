My name is Tian-Hua Yang, and I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. My potential advisor is <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin">Prof. Dima Abanin</a>.

My research interest lies in many-body quantum dynamics, specifically in understanding the mechanisms behind thermalization and its absence. I am currently focused on the role of integrals of motion in quantum many-body systems, their impact on dynamics and steady states, and their stability against external disturbances.

Research I have done during my undergraduate studies include quantum simulations in optical Raman lattices and Rydberg atom systems, as well as non-Hermitian band theory and topology.
