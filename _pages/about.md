My name is Tian-Hua Yang, and I am currently a second-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. My advisor is <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin">Prof. Dima Abanin</a>.

My research interest lies in the theory of many-body quantum dynamics. Broadly, I am looking to understanding the mechanisms behind thermalization and its absence, with a focus on the perspective of operator dynamics and the role of dissipation.

I am also interested in applying novel mathematical tools to quantum many-body physics. One current topic I am interested in is free probability theory.

My research experience also includes quantum simulations theory and non-Hermitian physics. I am also broadly interested in bridging "non-Hermitian physics" and non-unitary many-body dynamics.
