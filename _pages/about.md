My name is Tian-Hua Yang. I am currently a third-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. My advisor is <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin">Prof. Dima Abanin</a>.

My research interest lies in the theory of many-body quantum dynamics. Broadly, I am interesting in all sorts of interesting phenomena and emergent structure hidden intricatedly in the vast Hilbert space of quantum many-body systems. I am working on a range of topics, including:
<ul>
<li>Dissipative (Lindbladian) dynamics, with an operator-space perspective;</li>
<li>Hamiltonian learning;</li>
<li>Quantum thermalization;</li>
<li>Hilbert space fragmentation;</li>
</ul>

I am also generally interested in: quantum simulations, non-Hermitian physics, and applying novel mathematical tools to quantum many-body physics.
