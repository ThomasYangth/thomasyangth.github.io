My name is Tian-Hua Yang, and I am currently a second-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. My advisor is <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin">Prof. Dima Abanin</a>.

My research interest lies in the theory of many-body quantum dynamics. Broadly, I am interesting in all sorts of interesting phenomena and emergent structure hidden intricatedly in the vast Hilbert space of quantum many-body systems. In specific, I am focusing on (1) operator dynamics and (2) the role of dissipation. 

I am also generally interested in: quantum simulations, non-Hermitian physics, and applying novel mathematical tools to quantum many-body physics.
