My name is Tian-Hua Yang. I'm currently a first year graduate student at the Department of Physics, Princeton University. My research focus in on quantum many-body dynamics. My potential advisor is Prof. Dima Abanin.

Research areas that I have touched upon during my undergrad include quantum simulations in optical Raman lattices and Rydberg atom systems, non-Hermitian physics and topology.
