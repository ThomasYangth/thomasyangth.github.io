My name is Tian-Hua Yang, and I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Princeton University. My advisor is <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin">Prof. Dima Abanin</a>.

My research interest lies in many-body quantum dynamics, specifically in understanding the mechanisms behind thermalization and its absence. I am currently focused on the role of integrals of motion in quantum many-body systems, their impact on dynamics and steady states, and their stability against external disturbances.

I am also interested in applying novel mathematical tools to quantum many-body physics. One current topic I am interested in is free probability theory.

My research experience also includes quantum simulations and non-Hermitian physics. I am also broadly interested in bridging "non-Hermitian physics" and non-unitary many-body dynamics.
