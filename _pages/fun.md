I was a BP (British Parliamentary) debater during my undergrad. I participated in numerous debating tournaments, include the World University Debating Championship (WUDC) in 2021. I won EFL (English as Foreign Language) champion twice in Asian championships.

I am a heavy user of LLMs during my research and I'm broadly interested in the advancement of AI.
