I gave a 10-minute presentation of my recent work showing that the spectrum of weakly-dissipative Lindbladians can reveal the structure of integrals of motion of generic Hamiltonians and unitaries. See the abstract and slides <a href="https://summit.aps.org/events/MAR-Q29/11">here</a>. We expect to have the paper on arxiv in a month or two.
