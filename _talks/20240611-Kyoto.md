As an informal seminar during <a href="https://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yitpmolecule-topology-2024/index.php">a conference at YITP</a>, I introduced my recent work with Prof. Chen Fang, in which we provided a theory to characterize the Green's function on the edge of non-Hermitian lattices that experience the non-Hermitian skin effect. These results will appear in a preprint soon.
